## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid & Flexbox
- React.js

### What I learned

This was a fairly easy component to build. Got decent practice of useState & some JavaScript short-circuit evaluation. The JSX structure was really simple. I will be moving on to some slightly complex components from now on.
